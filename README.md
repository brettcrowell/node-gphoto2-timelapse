The classes found in this package allow users to run clock-time based timelapses using Node.JS, gPhoto2, and optionally SunCalc & AWS.  This project was designed specifically to run headless on a Raspberry Pi, using Forever.

## Basic Installation

This package relies heavily on external software.  Below you'll find a crash course to get your Pi up and running.  Most other machines should come up by following similar steps.

1) Install gPhoto2 using the gPhoto2 Updater (https://github.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater)

```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater/master/gphoto2-updater.sh && chmod +x gphoto2-updater.sh && sudo ./gphoto2-updater.sh
```

2) Install Node.JS.  Note that on the Pi, we must use an ARM distribution (http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/) and for node-gphoto2, we must be using Node 10...

```sh
wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_0.10.35_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i node_0.10.35_armhf.deb
```
_Non Raspberry Pi users may want to consider using NVM to maintain multiple versions of Node.  More information can be found at https://github.com/creationix/nvm_

3) Install node-gyp to ease the installation of node-gphoto2...

```sh
sudo npm install -g node-gyp
```

4) Install node-gphoto2 globally...

```sh
sudo npm install -g gphoto2
```

5) And finally, clone this repo...

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:brettcrowell/node-gphoto2-timelapse.git
```

### USB Reset Script

During the course of a long-running capture, gPhoto2 may lose its connection to the camera.  If this situation is detected, `node-gphoto2-timelapse` will execute a script which resets the USB port the camera is connected to.

In order for this all to work, that script (`usbreset.c`) must be compiled using `gcc` before running the app...

```
$ gcc -o usbreset usbreset.c
```

## Usage

As mentioned above, this package allows you to create timelapses based on clock-time.  This is facilitated by two main classes, Sequence and Timelapse.

A `Sequence` is a specialized queue whose elements are exposure times, represented as Objects containing UTC timestamps and metadata such as a filename prefix and S3 Bucket (if applicable).  A sample object follows...

```
{
  name: 'sunrise',
  saveAfterUpload: false,
  bucket: 'bcrowell-timelapse',
  ts: 1425380400000
}
```

_Note: If `bucket` is omitted, no attempt will be made to upload to S3, and `saveAfterUpload` will be set to true_

`Sequence` exposes two methods to its consumer, `getNextImage` and `hasMoreImages`.  Unlike a queue, `getNextImage` won't necessarialy return the object on top of the stack, but rather the next image whose timestamp is in the future.  If a sequence contains many exposures with timestamps that have passed, it will skip them.  This becomes extremely helpful in situations where a long-running capture might be interrupted.

When a `Timelapse` is created, a `Sequence` must be passed in.  `Timelapse` will then handle connecting to the camera, capturing each image at the correct time, downloading it from the camera, and saving or uploading to Amazon S3.

```js

// take 30 exposures, one every 30 seconds, starting immediatey
var now = new Date().getTime(),
    exposures = [];

for(var i = 0; i < 30; i++){
  exposureTimes.push({
    name: 'test-lapse',
    now + (i * 30000)
  });
}

var myTestSequence = new Sequence(exposures);

new Timelapse(myTestSequence);

```

To run the example above, assuming it is in a file called `simple-sample.js`, simply point node there...

```
$ node simple-sample.js
```

For longer running lapses, it can be very useful to install and use `forever`...

```
$ npm install -g forever
$ forever simple-sample.js
```
_More information on `forever` can be found at https://github.com/foreverjs/forever_

For a more complicated lapse based on sun position, check out `solar-sample.js`
